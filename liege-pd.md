## 📋 Overview

This project contains data and analysis pipelines for a set of **53 subjects** in a cross‑sectional PD study:

- **27 PD patients**  
- **26 age, sex, and education‑matched controls**  

The diffusion‑weighted images (DWI) were acquired with:

- **120 unique gradient directions**  
- **b = 1000 and b = 2500 s/mm²**  
- **Isotropic 2.4 mm³ voxels**  
- **Twice‑refocused spin‑echo sequence** to minimize eddy‑current distortions
